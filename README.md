# Overview of the analysis
* The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the island of Oahu could provide the optimal weather year-round to sustain an ice cream and surf shop business. 

# Results
* Based on the results, I believe it is plausible to sustain an ice cream style surf shop, as traffic should maintain based on the similar temperature readings.

* June analysis: 
* The mean temperature range varied 4 degrees, from a 75 degree mean value during the month of June, to a 71 degree mean value during the month of December. Both of these temperatures are suitable for surfing, as well as ice cream.

* December analysis:
* The 75th percentile grouping for the month of December showed a temperature value of 74 degrees, which is a suitable temperature for both surfing and ice cream. 
* The mean temperature value was 71 degrees, which accounted for the 50th percentile grouping, meaning that the majority of days in December were optimal weather conditions for both surfing and ice cream.

# Summary
* Based on the results from the statistical summary query, I feel fully confident that an ice cream styled surf shop would gather enough traffic to maintain a successful operating cash-flow. 
* To gain a more accurate reading of optimal days in the data, we could filter the precipitation readings to determine how many rainy days would affect the overall sales of ice cream and surf gear.

* Also, we could group the stations by their temperature readings and build closest to the station with the most optimal readings.
